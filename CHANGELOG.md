# CHANGELOG


## 2023-06-01

### Changed

* Remove the Docker Compose volume for node for more consistent builds. This fixes the problem where sometimes you had
  to run `docker compose run node npm install` after running `docker compose build` to install the node modules into the
  local node volume. Instead the node modules are always installed into the docker image.
